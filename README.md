# Latracal Solutions Private Limited | Product Website Assignment

This is the final submission to the assignment given to me for the application to the "Latracal Solutions Private Limited". I have designed the application using the ReactJS and used the vanilla CSS and Javascript to add the functionality to the website. The web app consists of -> Product List, Products, Product description card and Header.

Live website :- https://amratansh12.github.io/Product-site/


## Features

The web app consists of following functionalities :-

- Product List - All the items/products are rendered in the form of a list. Each item is clickable and upon clicking, it opens a product description card (It can also be triggered on clicking the product card in the products section)

- Products - It displays all the products in the form of a card. Each card consists of the Name, image, price and a short description of the product. Each card is clickable and upon clicking, it opens a product description card (It can also be triggered on clicking the product in the product list section). The concept is to design a card for one card and then dynamically filling the card properties using the array of products and reusing the card component (The basis of ReactJS).

- Header - It is the navigation bar on the top consisting of the title of the web app ("Latracal Products" here).

- Product description - It consists of a card in the middle of the screen displaying a detailed description of the product, its name and price. It also consist of a close button to close the description. This description can be toggled from the "Product list" as well as the "Products" section.
